The package helps running applications on the PHP development server. As a developer, you can use the package to develop
and test various functions within the application. It also accepts two additional options. You can use the host for
changing applicationâ€™s address and port.

## Requirements

Make sure that your server is configured with following PHP version and extensions:

- PHP 8.0+
- Spiral framework 2.9+

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spiral-packages/simple-php-server
```

After package install you need to register bootloader from the package.

```php
protected const LOAD = [
    // ...
    \Spiral\SimpleServer\Bootloader\SimpleServerBootloader::class,
];
```

> Note: if you are using [`spiral-packages/discoverer`](https://github.com/spiral-packages/discoverer),
> you don't need to register bootloader by yourself.

## Starting a server

```bash
php app.php serve
```
